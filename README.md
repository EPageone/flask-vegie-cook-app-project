# Code Institute Milestone Project 3 Backend Project - Vegie Cookapp

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a web application that allws users to add and store their own data ans be able to edit and delete. This used the CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functionality. As I like to cook I decided to create a cookapp that was for vegetarians and that the user could register, log in, use a profile, add recipes, edit recipes and manage what type of vegetables they could use and add more vegetables to the database. I used MongoDB for my database as a non-relational database. I found this easier to use and to add to rather than relational databases such as mysql. I used dictionaries in the database and languages such as python, html, css and jquery. It was deployed using Heroku and I constantly checked to make sure that it worked and was continuing to load and be able to use. 
 
Throughout this particular project I did struggle with the making sure I kept the MongoDB database clear and simple and I seemed to receive many errors that I had to overcome using python. I found that I am more confident in html and css languages and that jquery was easier to use than javascript, but still had to overcome a lot of earning curves. I was able to do this with support from Stack Overflow with quesions that had been asked before and realised that some of the code in python had changed their methods from remove to delete and using the correct methods, otherwise the devlopment could not be built. It was a difficult project, but feel quite proud that I managed to produce something that users can add, update, edit and delete and I created two users one for a regular user that add recipes but cannot see the rest of the databases that an admin user can see.

## UX Design

### User Design

1. Any user can register, login and add to the reipe database and logout
2. Any user can use the dropdown to choose their veg type and then add to an ingredients list and then give a recipe description.
3. Any user can edit their own recipes and also have access to the homepage which has five recipes their which they can try out. These cannot be edited by the user. 
4. The admin user has access to the manage vegies database and can add more vegetabels to the database, but the registered user does not have access. 
5. All users including admin user can search on the home page any keywords and that the database will update itself accordingly. For example if the user searches for mushrooms, then the recipes that include mushrooms will stay on the home page and the others that do not, remove themselves from the homepage. If the user resets the page then all the recipes appear. 
6. All users including admin can logout of the system and then login again.
